# Algorithm Score

* **Accuracy:** measures the goodness of a classification model as the proportion of true results to total cases.

* **Precision :** proportion of true results over all positive results.

* **Recall:** is the fraction of all correct results returned by the model.

* **F-score** is computed as the weighted average of precision and recall between 0 and 1, where the ideal F-score value is 1.

* **Support** the number of samples of the true response that lie in that class.

* **AUC** measures the area under the curve plotted with true positives on the y axis and false positives on the x axis. This metric is useful because it provides a single number that lets you compare models of different types.

* **Average log loss** is a single score used to express the penalty for wrong results. It is calculated as the difference between two probability distributions â€“ the true one, and the one in the model.

* **Training log loss** is a single score that represents the advantage of the classifier over a random prediction.

# Precision
### **Precision** attempts to answer the following question:
> What proportion of positive identifications was actually correct?



```math
Precision = TP/(TP-FP)
```

---
# Recall
### **Recall** attempts to answer the following question:

> What proportion of actual positives was identified correctly?

```math
Recall = TP/(TP+FN)

```

---



# When to use
Accuracy bad in unbalanced datasets.
Use Persision and Recall

```
What is an umbalnced dataset
Total Observations = 1000
Fraudulent  Observations = 20
Non Fraudulent Observations = 980

Event Rate= 2 %

```

# Should I use persision or recall?

* F1 score waited persision vs recall equally
* F1 score is the harmonic average of persision and recall
* 1 is best
* 0 is worst

# Confusion Matrix
Predicted label and true label

|                | Class 1 Predicted | Class 2 Predicted |
|:--------------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|
| Class 1 Actual | TP                | FN                |
| Class 2 Actual | FP                | TN                |

# Regression


* **Regression analysis** is a statistical process for estimating the relationships among dependent and independent(predictor) variables.

* Regression analysis is widely used for prediction and forecasting,
 can be used to infer causal relationship (can lead to error: correlation does not imply causation)

* regression may refer specifically to the estimation of continuous response variables, as opposed to the discrete response variables used in classification
