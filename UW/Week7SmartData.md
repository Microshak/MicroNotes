* **Accuracy:** measures the goodness of a classification model as the proportion of true results to total cases.

* **Precision :** proportion of true results over all positive results.

* **Recall:** is the fraction of all correct results returned by the model.

* **F-score** is computed as the weighted average of precision and recall between 0 and 1, where the ideal F-score value is 1.

* **AUC** measures the area under the curve plotted with true positives on the y axis and false positives on the x axis. This metric is useful because it provides a single number that lets you compare models of different types.

* **Average log loss** is a single score used to express the penalty for wrong results. It is calculated as the difference between two probability distributions â€“ the true one, and the one in the model.

* **Training log loss** is a single score that represents the advantage of the classifier over a random prediction.

# When to use
Accuracy bad in unballanced datasets.
Use Persision and Recall


How much we value persision vs recall?


F1 score waited persision vs recall equally

F Score when we value persision vs recall

# Confusion Matrix
Predicted label and true label

# Ways to drive bad numbers down
* density of predictions
* change hyper parameters
* Add freatures

# Regression


* **Regression analysis** is a statistical process for estimating the relationships among dependent and independent(predictor) variables.

* Regression analysis is widely used for prediction and forecasting,
 can be used to infer causal relationship (can lead to error: correlation does not imply causation)

* regression may refer specifically to the estimation of continuous response variables, as opposed to the discrete response variables used in classification
