Uploading Zoom Recordings

 

Up to 500 MB:

Use the Canvas “Media Record/Upload” tool within a page to embed the video there. The video will only be accessible from that specific page.
You should only use the Media Record/Upload tool, rather than uploading to the general Files section. You only have 1GB of storage space in the Files section. However, uploading videos to the Media Record/Upload tool does not count against the file storage quota. It is limited to 500MB per video, but otherwise is effectively infinite.
Guide:

Larger than 500 MB:

Upload to Microsoft Streams (free service with UW’s agreement with Microsoft to provide Office 365 access with NetIDs), and then share the URL in Canvas, or embed the video into a page.
You can access Office 365 apps for UW from the upper left corner of this page (the waffle icon, which looks like a series of 9 squares): https://outlook.office365.com/uw.edu or https://web.microsoftstream.com and logging in with your @uw.edu email address.
We recommend setting the default permissions to “allow everyone in your company to view this video” and the default option of “autogenerate a captions file”
