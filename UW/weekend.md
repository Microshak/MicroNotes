There are very few Veracity models available in the literature, one of which is the Big Data
Veracity model: Objective, Truthful and Credible (OTC) 

 According to IBM Big Data & Analytics Hub [6], 27%
of the respondents were not sure about the accuracy of the data and one in three decision-makers
do not trust the information used for analyzing the data. 


Topic modeling refers to a generative model for analyzing large quantities of unlabeled
data. A topic is a probability distribution over the collection of words and topic model is the
statistical relationship between a group of observed and unknown random variables that specifies
a probabilistic procedure to generate the topics [13]. One of the most popular topic modeling
technique used is Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [13].


There are many other similar models and techniques related to topic models like Latent Semantic
Analysis (LSA), Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA), Non-negative matrix
factorization (NMF) and Correlated Topic Model (CTM). LSA is a statistical technique which deals
with extracting and representing the relations between words in a large corpus.
