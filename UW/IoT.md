# IoT Hub
    1. Evolution: Blob -> Event Hub -> Iot Hub

---
# Blob storage
    1. Data stored on 3 machines
    1. Redundant
    1. Fault tolerant
--- 
# Event Hub
    1. Stores data on Blob storage
    1. Stores data in files in timestamped files and folders
    1. Stores a journaled data in Avro files

## IoT Hub
    1. Build ontop of Event Hubs
    1. Has Device Level Security
    1. Has Device Twins
    1. Has Middle Ware options
        1. HTTP
        1. AMQP
        1. MQTT

## Architectures
    1. Event Based
    1. Big Data
    1. Reliable Actors
    1. Microservices
    1. Lambda, Kappa, Hot/Cold
