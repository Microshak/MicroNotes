# Group Discussion IoMT
Scenario: Company wants to get into the Internet of Medical Things.  They have an in home cardiology monitoring solution using a heart monitor connected to a cellphone.  The data is binary but needs to get converted and have algorithms run on it.

1. How to deal with streaming binary cardiology information.  The doctor needs to see real-time streaming data when the patient pushes a button on the device.
2. Every day the device generates 8 GBs of data.  They patient sends the device back after a week one of a dozen processing centers.  The processing converts the 8gbs a day of binary to 16 gb of searchable medical data. With 10,000 devices the processing centers can't buy a internet pipe big enough to send it to the cloud.  What do they do?

# Big Data 230 Week 5 Veracity 

> A [Survey](https://home.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/co/pdf/2018/02/Guardians%20of%20trust%20_FINAL%20WEB.pdf) 2,190 global senior executives found that:  
> * Only 35% have a high level of trust in their organizations data and analytics
> * 25% Admit that they have limited trust or active distrust

# How do we get to smart data
* According to a [white paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5656-hidden-technical-debt-in-machine-learning-systems.pdf) published by Google most of their Data Scientist spend most of their time not writing ML code.

# Bias
* Design Bias
* Selection Bias (aka the reason we have  randomized double-blind placebo control studies)
   * Example: [Skull Size Research](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/crux/2018/10/31/morton-skulls-brain-size-controversy/#.XL-orHX0mV4)
  * [Selection Bias](https://www.math.upenn.edu/~deturck/m170/wk4/lecture/case1.html)
* Procedural Bias
* Confirmation Bias
  * Confirmation bias occurs when a researcher takes the hypothesis that he or she starts out with ("marijuana is beneficial/detrimental") and shapes the study methodology or results to confirms that premise, whether or not itâ€™s actually justified. 
  * Example: Discovery of [N-Rays](https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/200708/history.cfm)
* Implicit Bias (I'm Great)

# Understanding the Results
* Results are often the models confidence
* Machine Learning is Function ***Approximation*** 
  * It uses scored data sets
  * It gets close to predicting scored data sets
