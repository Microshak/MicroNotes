# Big Data 230 Week 5 Veracity 

> A [Survey](https://home.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/co/pdf/2018/02/Guardians%20of%20trust%20_FINAL%20WEB.pdf) 2,190 global senior executives found that:  
> * Only 35% have a high level of trust in their organizations data and analytics
> * 25% Admit that they have limited trust or active distrust

# Journey to Knowledge
* Knowledge is Actionable Information
* Discovering the Rooted Truth
* Machine Learning != Magic Learning

---

# Bias
* Design Bias
* Selection/Sampeling Bias (aka the reason we have  randomized double-blind placebo control studies)
    * Omission Bias
    * Inclusive Bias
    * Example: [Skull Size Research](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/crux/2018/10/31/morton-skulls-brain-size-controversy/#.XL-orHX0mV4)
* Procedural Bias
* Confirmation Bias
  * Confirmation bias occurs when a researcher takes the hypothesis that he or she starts out with ("marijuana is beneficial/detrimental") and shapes the study methodology or results to confirms that premise, whether or not itâ€™s actually justified. 
  * Example: Discovery of [N-Rays](https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/200708/history.cfm)
