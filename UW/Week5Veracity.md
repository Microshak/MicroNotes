# Regression


* **Regression analysis** is a statistical process for estimating the relationships among dependent and independent(predictor) variables.

* Regression analysis is widely used for prediction and forecasting,
 can be used to infer causal relationship (can lead to error: correlation does not imply causation)

* regression may refer specifically to the estimation of continuous response variables, as opposed to the discrete response variables used in classification
