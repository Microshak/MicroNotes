# Veracity 
Definition: conformity with truth or fact - ACCURACY

---
# Journey to Knowledge
* Knowledge is Actionable Information
* Discovering the Rooted Truth
* Machine Learning != Magic Learning

---
# IoT Journey to Value
* Duty Cycle
* Factor Analysis
  * Analysis of Varince
  * Time Series Analysis
* Feed Back Cycle
  * Right Sizing Data points
  * Enriching Data
* Iterative Process
---
# Social Sciences Jounrey to Truth
* Predictive Approaches
    * Byesian
    * Time Series
    * Frequentist
    * 

---
# Bias
* Design Bias
* Selection/Sampeling Bias (aka the reason we have  randomized double-blind placebo control studies)
    * Omission Bias
    * Inclusive Bias
    * Example: [Skull Size Research](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/crux/2018/10/31/morton-skulls-brain-size-controversy/#.XL-orHX0mV4)
* Procedural Bias
* Confirmation Bias
  * Confirmation bias occurs when a researcher takes the hypothesis that he or she starts out with ("marijuana is beneficial/detrimental") and shapes the study methodology or results to confirms that premise, whether or not itâ€™s actually justified. 
  * Example: Discovery of [N-Rays](https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/200708/history.cfm)

# ANOVA


# Regression


* **Regression analysis** is a statistical process for estimating the relationships among dependent and independent(predictor) variables.

* Regression analysis is widely used for prediction and forecasting,
 can be used to infer causal relationship (can lead to error: correlation does not imply causation)

* regression may refer specifically to the estimation of continuous response variables, as opposed to the discrete response variables used in classification
