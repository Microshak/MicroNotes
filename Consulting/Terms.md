### Bike shedding
Forgoing architecture discussions to talk about something trivial. YOu are working on a nucular powerplant design and someone wants to take an hour to talk about the color of the bike shed.

### Gold Plating
In time management, gold plating is the phenomenon of working on a project or task past the point of diminishing returns

Requirements Gold-plating: after having met the requirements, the project manager or the developer works on further enhancing the product, thinking the customer will be delighted to see additional or more polished features, rather than what was asked for or expected. The customer might be disappointed in the results, and the extra effort by the developer might be futile

Developer gold-plating. Developers are fascinated by new technology and are sometimes anxious to try out new features of their language or environment or to create their own implementation of a slick feature they saw in another product--whether or not it's required in their product. The effort required to design, implement, test, document, and support features that are not required lengthens the schedule.

### Code Smell
Because sometimes a mess is smelled before it’s seen, code smell refers to code that displays early signs of problems within a program.  


### Duck punching
A monkey patch is a way for a program to extend or modify supporting system software locally (affecting only the running instance of the program).

### Yak shaving
Yak shaving is programming lingo for the seemingly endless series of small tasks that have to be completed before the next step in a project can move forward.

### rubber duck debugging
In software engineering, rubber duck debugging is a method of debugging code by articulating a problem in spoken or written natural language. The name is a reference to a story in the book The Pragmatic Programmer in which a programmer would carry around a rubber duck and debug their code by forcing themselves to explain it, line-by-line, to the duck.

### Dog Fooding
the use of a newly developed product or service by a company's staff to test it before it is made available to customers.

### Architect astronaut

When you go too far up, abstraction-wise, you run out of oxygen. Sometimes smart thinkers just don’t know when to stop, and they create these absurd, all-encompassing, high-level pictures of the universe that are all good and fine, but don’t actually mean anything at all. These are the people I call Architecture Astronauts.


### Functional Decompensition
Break things down into smaller parts.


### A duck

A feature added for the sole purpose of drawing attention to itself from management to be removed, avoiding unnecessary other changes in a product.# 


### Creating a Jimmy
Writing system that only the developer knows how to use.  You would need to ask the developer if you wanted to use it.

### Fear-driven development 
When project management adds more pressure, such as by firing engineers.
