I’m very proud to announce that Neudesic has achieved the Modernization of Web Apps to Microsoft Azure Advanced Specialization. This recognition validates Neudesic’s deep knowledge, extensive experience, and proven success in migrating and deploying production web application workloads, applying DevOps practices, and managing application services in Microsoft Azure.

Microsoft is placing a HUGE level of focus on partners who achieve Advanced Specializations in their priority areas. They’re reserved for top-tier Microsoft partners who are able to satisfy a rigorous set of requirements, achieve numerous technical certifications, provide significant delivery experience, and undergo a thorough six-hour audit conducted by a third-party firm.

This achievement will directly benefit Neudesic in three important ways:

1) We’ll receive more Microsoft referrals, as they are increasingly driving engagement and referrals toward their specialization partners.

2) We’ll get access to more Microsoft funding, as satisfying advanced specializations is now a pre-requisite for obtaining key AMMP funding that we need to co-sell.

3) We’ll be recognized by Microsoft leadership teams as a distinguished partner, which will drive even more national and regional engagement, co-selling, and more

This is a big accomplishment for Neudesic and just the start of a move toward achieving even more Microsoft Advanced Specializations in the months to come to further differentiate us in the Microsoft partner ecosystem.

All candidates will approach this presentation thinking of us a client they presenting to, not a rehash of their resume.
 
Technical topic- App innovation 

They can determine the flow and agenda. We are looking to understand:

What it is? Help us understand the technology.

How can it help our clients (business impact)?

Examples where they have implemented it or made an impact. If this is something new, cite industry examples.
Anything else they feel is necessary.

Overall looking for about a 20-30 minute of content. The audience will include Architect level people and Director level in the business (they know technology but are not technical).

We would like to know they can communicate relevant technical concepts to both a technical and non-technical audience. We should leave understanding what the technology is and the value. We should also walk away thinking this person would be a trusted person to lead our clients through adopting or implementing solutions using the technology discussed.
