# PCI
## Or PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) 

**An industry requirement for securing cardholder data around the world**

`There are 6 Standards`
---

# 1. Build and Maintain a Secure Network and Systems
This outlines requirements for network security. Specifically, it requires organizations to install and maintain firewalls and routers, and not to use vendor-supplied defaults. All of the controls in this category are about securing your network and implementing proper network security mechanisms.

# 2. Protect Cardholder Data
This is a data security category. It’s concerned with the protection of the data elements themselves, regardless of their form. That could be data in storage, in transit, in processing, or even in physical form, such as paper records like invoices or receipts. All of that data would be in scope, making tokenization and encryption appropriate measures for obfuscation.

# 3. Maintain a Vulnerability Management Program
This category is concerned with application security, so it details how an organization should protect its systems against malware, viruses, coding exploitations, and other items that affect application security. Potential solutions here could include antivirus software and security filters.


---

# 4. Implement Strong Access Control Measures
The first two requirements here address identity and access control measures. Identity refers to how to authenticate a user, and access control determines the user’s permission or access level to certain resources within your environment, specifically to cardholder data. The third aspect covers controls for physical access, such as requiring locks, cameras, etc., to prevent unauthorized physical access to a server room or data center.

# 5. Regularly Monitor Test Networks
This requirement is not so much concerned with implementing new security mechanisms as it is maintaining your existing ones and ensuring they are sufficient. You need to be able to monitor your own network and detect security incidents if and when they occur. You also need to test your security systems and coding to ensure they are secure and functional, update and patch applications, and keep up with threat management for malware and viruses.

# 6. Maintain an Information Security Policy
This is essentially a policy that sets the tone for your entire organization’s information security strategy. It needs to address all of your employees and reflect your attitude toward PCI compliance and overall data security. This includes training programs and continuing education to ensure proper practices.
