Information Assurance is defined as the set of measures intended to protect and defend information and information systems by ensuring their availability, integrity, authentication, confidentiality, and non-repudiation. This includes providing for restoration of information systems by incorporating protection, detection, and reaction capabilities.

Confidentiality - This requirement maintains control on information access and disclosure. Transmitted and stored data is encrypted for privacy.
Integrity - This requirement prevents improper addition, modification, or destruction of data and information. Access controls should also be in place to protect stored data.
Availability - This requirement ensures information can be accessed when it is required. 



Confidentiality

he AAA framework provides the three major security services including:  Authentication (who are you), Authorisation (what can you access), and Accounting (when did you access).


Integrity
Integrity is the need to verify the quality of data by ensuring the accuracy, relevance, consistency, and reliability of data in all operational processes including data capture, storage, retrieval, updating and transfer. 


Authentication
Authentication is a security service designed to establish the validity of a transmission, message, or originator, or as a means of verifying an individual’s authorisation to receive specific categories of information.

Technologies
Software-based technology countermeasures are programs and services installed on devices to protect their operating systems, databases and services. Some examples of software-based technologies are firewalls, network and port scanners, protocol or signature analysers, vulnerability scanners, and intrusion detection systems.

Hardware-based technology countermeasures are devices that protect the information systems’ assets from cybersecurity attacks such as firewall appliances and content filtering services, Dedicated Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS).

Network-based technology countermeasures are used to secure the information systems assets on the network using technologies such as Virtual Private Network (VPN), Network Access Control (NAC), and security measures on wireless access points. 

Cloud-based technology countermeasures are implemented by cloud service providers as virtual security appliances on a cloud virtual environment. This virtual environment is the basis of the most popular cloud computing services including Software as a Service (SaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and IT as a Service (ITaaS).

More information on the different types of technology countermeasures will be presented in Module 3.

Operational policies and practices
Operations encompasses the procedures employed by system users, the configurations implemented by system administrators, and the conventions invoked by software during specified system operations. It should address all data, programs, systems, facilities, technical infrastructure, users of technology and third parties in a given organisation.

Cybersecurity policy, standards, guidelines, and procedures are documents supporting an organisation’s comprehensive cybersecurity implementation. Security policy documents usually include:

Identification and authentication policies
Password policies
Acceptable use policies (AUP)
Remote access policies 
Network maintenance policies 
Incident handling policies

Cybersecurity guidelines incorporate instructions on how to efficiently and securely operate within an organisation. An example might be to suggest a method of creating a secure password by using a known phrase such as “I have a dream” and replacing some letters with special characters to create “Ihav3@dr3@m”.
