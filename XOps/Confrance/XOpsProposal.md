MLOps and DataOps: Using DevOps priniples to super charge your AI

In 2015 Google did a study to find how much effort it took to release a ML model to production.  In it they found that the vast majority of time and effort for realeasing ML Models to produciton was not in creating the ML Model. It was all of the other factors such as servers, configuration, and deployment that took up the vast majority of resources. Many companies face  cahllenges delivering models to production because of the complexity it takes to deliver these models.  In addition some companies fail due to not implementing the XOps principels.

The DevOps paradigm's bottom up approach has allowed developers and IT people to quickly bring software to market in a way that puts guard rails on that process that creates not only reliability in the deployment but confidance that the software will be stabel when deployed.  One of the biggest issue with with Data data science is trust and confidance in the models.
