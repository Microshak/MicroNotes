# Outlier Detection
1. Min/Max
2. Std
3. Clustering
4. Is my data ballanced?  Need to use Accuracy vs FScore

# Null handling
1. 0/1
2. Avg, mean, mode
3. predict

# Purpose of feature selection

1. Reducing computational Costs
2. Reducing the cost associated with data collection
3. Improving interpretability
4. The curse of dimensionality
5. Improving accuracy
