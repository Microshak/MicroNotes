* Grid Search: Exhaustively search through a predefined set of hyperparameter values, evaluating each combination.
* Random Search: Sample hyperparameter values randomly from specified distributions, covering a wider search space.
* Bayesian Optimization: Model the objective function using a surrogate model (e.g., Gaussian Process) and iteratively select hyperparameters based on acquisition function.
* Tree-structured Parzen Estimators (TPE): Model the probability distribution of hyperparameters given the past performance, and sample the most promising regions.
* Genetic Algorithms: Use evolutionary algorithms to evolve a population of hyperparameter combinations, applying mutation and crossover operations.
* Population-Based Training (PBT): Train models with different hyperparameters simultaneously, periodically adjusting hyperparameters based on the performance of other models in the population.
* Early Stopping: Terminate the training process when performance on the validation set stops improving, saving time and computational resources.
* Learning Rate Schedulers: Adjust the learning rate during training using schedulers (e.g., step decay, cosine annealing) to find an optimal learning rate.
* Cross-Validation: Use k-fold cross-validation or stratified k-fold cross-validation to estimate model performance across different hyperparameter combinations.
* Software Tools: Employ tools like scikit-learn, Optuna, or Hyperopt for implementing and automating hyperparameter tuning strategies.
