Mean absolute error (MAE)   measures how close the predictions are to the actual outcomes; thus, a lower score is better.
Root mean squared error (RMSE)  creates a single value that summarizes the error in the model. By squaring the difference, the metric disregards the difference between over-prediction and under-prediction.
Relative absolute error (RAE)    is the relative absolute difference between expected and actual values; relative because the mean difference is divided by the arithmetic mean.
Relative squared error (RSE)     similarly normalizes the total squared error of the predicted values by dividing by the total squared error of the actual values.
Mean Zero One Error (MZOE)  indicates whether the prediction was correct or not. In other words: ZeroOneLoss(x,y) = 1 when x!=y; otherwise 0
Coefficient of determination     often referred to as R2, represents the predictive power of the model as a value between 0 and 1. Zero means the model is random (explains nothing); 1 means there is a perfect fit. However, caution should be used in interpreting R2 values, as low values can be entirely normal and high values can be suspect.
