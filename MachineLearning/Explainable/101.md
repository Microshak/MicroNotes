# Explaining ML Models


---

## Statistics and ScoreCards
* Uses Linear Models
* Just have coeffiecents
* Very interpeable but too much bias not flexable enough to fit the data.
*  


---
## GAM Gerative Additive Models
* Uses Local Regression 
* Locally fits a linear function

linear response variable depends linearly on unknown smooth functions of some predictor variables, and interest focuses on inference about these smooth functions
