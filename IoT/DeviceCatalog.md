* **[Plug and Play](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/build-with-azure-iot-central-and-iot-plug-and-play/)**: 
* Plug and play is an JSON format that templates a device in IoT Central 
With plug and play you can specify:

* Rules and alerts: The powerful rules engine, backed by Azure Stream Analytics, enables monitoring and alerts on any events that affect device health and usage. It delivers clean and consistent data to the line of business apps by integrating with Azure Functions, Microsoft Flow, and Logic Apps.
Visualization: Multiple dashboards and data visualization options are available for different types of users. Instead of using a one-size-fits-all approach, application administrators can now create custom views for different types of users.
* Connectors: Inbound and outbound data connectors allow operators to integrate with third-party systems. Use the device bridge to ingest data from other clouds into an Azure IoT Central application. For example, the continuous data export feature brings data into downstream business applications.
* Personalization: Add custom branding and operator resources to an Azure IoT Central application with new white labeling options for a better visual fit with your organizationâ€™s other applications.
* Device management: Manage devices at scale with ease. Copy a job created earlier, save a job to finish later, stop or resume a running job, and download a job details report after completion. The new Device Template library makes it easier to onboard and model devices, while new device authoring separates the template from the device and simplifies the overall experience.
