# Descriptive
* Benefits
    * Understand Data
    * Validate Instrument
* Examples
    * ANOVA
    * Descriptive Statistics
    * Exploratory/Explanatory Factor Analysis
    * Correlation

# Prescriptive
* Benefits
    * Low CPU
    * Rules based
    * Best Course of Action
* Examples
    * Battery Life Saver
    * Equipment Maintenance

# Predictive


Algorithms
    * [Linear Regression](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.11/tensorflow/examples/get_started/regression/linear_regression.py)
    * [Remaining Useful Life](https://github.com/umbertogriffo/Predictive-Maintenance-using-LSTM)

---
# Inferential
* Basic correlation between different elements. 
* Test new instruments
* 
* Example
    * [Correlation](https://pythonfordatascience.org/correlation-python/)
  ###### Warning
* Icecream does not cause polio
---
# Causal
Changing one factor causes a change in another. Such as A/B Testing
*  Example
    * Amazon Recommendations
    * Tensorflow serving
    * Battery Life Savings
