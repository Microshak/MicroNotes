Druid 

# Data Models 

## In General 

Flat data is needed.  Nested or relational data is not recommended. 

Use RollUps for preaggregation 

 

 

## Times Series Model 

(Like Influxdb) 

Druid is not a time series database, but its data model requires a timestamp 

 

 

## Log Aggregatyion Model 

(Like Elasticsearch) 

Uses Inverted indexing for fast searching and filtering. 

While similar to Elasticsearch has less search capabilities and more analytical capabilities.
