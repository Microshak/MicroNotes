“He who sweats more in training bleeds less in battle.”

― Spartan Warrior Creed

Jeff Atwood: “the best code is no code at all. Every new line of code you willingly bring into the world is code that has to be debugged, code that has to be read and understood, code that has to be supported. Every time you write new code, you should do so reluctantly, under duress, because you completely exhausted all your other options.”

I like Bill Gates' quote "Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft building progress by weight."
