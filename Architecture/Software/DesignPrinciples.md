# SOLID

# Single responsibility
Every class should have 1 and only 1 resopnsibliity

# Open Close 
Classes should be open for extenstion but closed for modification

# Liskov Substitution prinicple
over ridden method of the subclass need to accept the same method signature fo the super class


# Interface segratation priniple 
No client should depend on methods it does not use
break apart large interfaces into smaller more specific onces

# Dependancy infersion principel
Avoid top down dependancy chains
Seperate your dependancy chain with abstractions
