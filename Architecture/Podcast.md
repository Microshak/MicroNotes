1) What distinguishes AI from AI for IoT/digital transformation?
Tractor 
Geo Fence
AI what to spray
descriptive predictive and prescriptive

- What are the common IoT-related data types? time series, ...

        Data types
        once a day - Mouse traps
        once every second - Streaming monitoring
          Device twins
          Blob Storage
        Hurtz 5000 MIoT IIot
         FDA

 - Data pipeline differences, software development differences
     Capability Difference
     Industial PC $1000s
     Raspberry Pi Class - $35
     Microcontrollers $1 two billion microcontrollers being produced every year

2) In industrial IoT, what are the most common use cases for machine learning?  Give list but I'll ask about predictive maintenance, anomaly detection and computer vision.  For each, I will ask:
 - General description
 - Data science problem we're trying to solve
 - Data needed
 - Math and algos used
 - ML pipeline

Factory
Air Gap
High speed
  Vibrabitor
  Heat
Digital Twin - Factory

Drone
  Computer Vision

AR

RUL 20 years
Pump




3) What are your best practices?
 - How do you decide if AI can add value?
ROI
Silicon Vendors

 - Mention why data scientists need to be the ones driving sensors and sensor placement on new devices



4) How can people make contact and learn more about what weâ€™ve been discussing?
