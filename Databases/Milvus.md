## 2.1 Introduction to Vector Databases

### What are Vector Databases?

Traditional databases are designed to store and retrieve structured data—think rows and columns of numbers, dates, and text. However, as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have advanced, so has the need to store and search more complex data types, such as images, audio, and unstructured text. These data types are often represented as high-dimensional vectors, also known as **embeddings**, which capture the semantic meaning or features of the data.

A **vector database** is a specialized database built to efficiently store, index, and search these high-dimensional vectors. Unlike conventional databases that excel at exact matches and simple queries, vector databases are optimized for **similarity search**—finding items that are "close" to a given vector in terms of mathematical distance (e.g., cosine similarity or Euclidean distance). This capability is essential for powering modern AI applications, such as semantic search, recommendation systems, and generative AI workflows.

---

### Why Vector Databases for Gen AI?

Generative AI (Gen AI) models, such as large language models (LLMs) and multimodal models, rely heavily on embeddings to represent and process information. For example, when you want to retrieve relevant documents to augment an LLM’s response (a technique known as **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**, or **RAG**), you need to compare the semantic similarity between user queries and a large corpus of documents. This is where vector databases shine.

**Key reasons to use vector databases in Gen AI workflows include:**

- **Scalability:** Efficiently handle millions or billions of vectors, enabling real-time search and retrieval.
- **Performance:** Provide fast, approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search, which is critical for interactive AI applications.
- **Flexibility:** Support a variety of data types and embedding models, making them adaptable to different Gen AI use cases.
- **Integration:** Seamlessly connect with AI pipelines, allowing for end-to-end automation from data ingestion to inference.

---

### Key Use Cases in the Enterprise

Vector databases are rapidly becoming a foundational technology for enterprise AI. Some of the most impactful use cases include:

- **Semantic Search:** Enhance search engines to understand user intent and context, delivering more relevant results for queries in natural language.
- **Recommendation Systems:** Power personalized recommendations by matching user preferences with product or content embeddings.
- **Document Retrieval for LLMs:** Enable Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by efficiently surfacing relevant knowledge base articles, FAQs, or documents to supplement LLM responses.
- **Fraud Detection:** Identify anomalous patterns in transaction or user behavior by comparing vector representations of activities.
- **Image and Video Search:** Allow users to search for similar images or videos based on content, not just metadata or tags.
- **Customer Support Automation:** Match incoming support tickets or chat messages to existing solutions or similar cases, improving response accuracy and speed.

## 2.4 Data Preparation and Ingestion

Before you can leverage Milvus for vector search and AI-powered applications, you need to prepare your data, generate embeddings, design an appropriate schema, and ingest your data into the database. This section walks you through each step, ensuring your data is ready for efficient and effective vector search.

---

### Understanding Vectors: Embeddings and Their Sources

At the heart of vector databases are **embeddings**—dense, high-dimensional numerical representations of data. Embeddings capture the semantic meaning or features of various data types, such as text, images, or audio, in a way that makes them suitable for similarity search.

**Common sources of embeddings:**

- **Text:** Language models (e.g., Azure OpenAI, BERT, Sentence Transformers) convert sentences, paragraphs, or documents into vectors.
- **Images:** Computer vision models (e.g., ResNet, CLIP) generate embeddings for images.
- **Audio:** Audio models (e.g., Wav2Vec) produce vector representations of sound clips.
- **Multimodal:** Some models (e.g., CLIP) can generate embeddings for both text and images, enabling cross-modal search.

The choice of embedding model depends on your data type and use case. For most enterprise Gen AI applications, text embeddings are the most common starting point.

---

### Generating Embeddings

Let’s look at how to generate text embeddings using **Azure OpenAI** and **Hugging Face**:

#### Using Azure OpenAI Embeddings

To use Azure OpenAI, you’ll need your Azure endpoint, API key, and the deployment name for your embedding model (e.g., `text-embedding-ada-002`).

<pre><code class="language-python">
import openai

# Set your Azure OpenAI credentials
openai.api_type = "azure"
openai.api_base = "https://<your-resource-name>.openai.azure.com/"
openai.api_version = "2023-05-15"
openai.api_key = "<your-azure-openai-key>"

def get_azure_openai_embedding(text, deployment="your-embedding-deployment"):
    response = openai.Embedding.create(
        input=text,
        engine=deployment  # Use the deployment name you set up in Azure
    )
    return response['data'][0]['embedding']

embedding = get_azure_openai_embedding("Enterprise AI is transforming business.")
</code></pre>

#### Using Hugging Face Transformers

<pre><code class="language-python">
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

def get_hf_embedding(text):
    return model.encode(text).tolist()

embedding = get_hf_embedding("Enterprise AI is transforming business.")
</code></pre>

> **Tip:** Always normalize your embeddings (e.g., using L2 normalization) if your similarity metric requires it.

---

### Data Schema Design in Milvus

Milvus organizes data into **collections** (similar to tables in relational databases). Each collection has a schema that defines:

- **Primary Key:** A unique identifier for each record (e.g., `id`).
- **Vector Field:** The field that stores the embedding (e.g., `embedding`).
- **Scalar Fields:** Additional metadata (e.g., `title`, `category`, `timestamp`).

**Example schema for a document collection:**

<pre><code class="language-python">
from pymilvus import FieldSchema, CollectionSchema, DataType, Collection

fields = [
    FieldSchema(name="id", dtype=DataType.INT64, is_primary=True, auto_id=True),
    FieldSchema(name="embedding", dtype=DataType.FLOAT_VECTOR, dim=1536),  # 1536 for ada-002
    FieldSchema(name="title", dtype=DataType.VARCHAR, max_length=256),
    FieldSchema(name="category", dtype=DataType.VARCHAR, max_length=64)
]

schema = CollectionSchema(fields, description="Document collection with embeddings")
collection = Collection("documents", schema)
</code></pre>

**Best Practices:**

- Set the vector dimension (`dim`) to match your embedding model output (e.g., 1536 for Azure OpenAI `text-embedding-ada-002`).
- Use scalar fields for metadata to enable hybrid search and filtering.

---

### Ingesting Data: Batch and Streaming Methods

Milvus supports both **batch** and **streaming** ingestion, allowing you to efficiently load data at scale or in real time.

#### Batch Ingestion

Batch ingestion is ideal for loading large datasets all at once.

<pre><code class="language-python">
import numpy as np

# Example data
titles = ["AI in Healthcare", "Gen AI in Finance"]
categories = ["healthcare", "finance"]
embeddings = [get_azure_openai_embedding(t, deployment="your-embedding-deployment") for t in titles]

# Prepare data in columnar format
data = [
    embeddings,  # embedding vectors
    titles,      # title metadata
    categories   # category metadata
]

collection.insert(data)
</code></pre>

#### Streaming Ingestion

For real-time applications, you can insert data as it arrives (e.g., new documents, user queries).

<pre><code class="language-python">
new_title = "AI for Customer Support"
new_category = "customer_support"
new_embedding = get_azure_openai_embedding(new_title, deployment="your-embedding-deployment")

collection.insert([
    [new_embedding],  # embedding
    [new_title],      # title
    [new_category]    # category
])
</code></pre>

---

**After Ingestion:**

- Build an index on your vector field for fast search (covered in the next section).
- Optionally, persist and back up your data.

---

With your data prepared, embedded, and ingested into Milvus, you’re ready to perform fast, scalable vector search and build advanced Gen AI applications. Next, we’ll explore core CRUD operations and practical recipes for querying your data.


## 2.5 Core Recipes: CRUD Operations

### Recipe 1: Creating a Collection and Defining Schema

Before you can store and search embeddings in Milvus, you need to create a **collection**—the equivalent of a table in a relational database. Each collection requires a schema that defines the structure of your data, including the primary key, vector field, and any additional metadata fields.

---

#### Step 1: Connect to Milvus

First, ensure you are connected to your Milvus instance using the Python SDK:

<pre><code class="language-python">
from pymilvus import connections

connections.connect("default", host="localhost", port="19530")
</code></pre>

> Replace `localhost` and `19530` with your Milvus host and port if different.

---

#### Step 2: Define the Schema

Suppose you want to store document embeddings generated by Azure OpenAI’s `text-embedding-ada-002` model (vector dimension 1536), along with a title and category for each document.

<pre><code class="language-python">
from pymilvus import FieldSchema, CollectionSchema, DataType

fields = [
    FieldSchema(
        name="id",
        dtype=DataType.INT64,
        is_primary=True,
        auto_id=True  # Let Milvus auto-generate unique IDs
    ),
    FieldSchema(
        name="embedding",
        dtype=DataType.FLOAT_VECTOR,
        dim=1536  # Set to match your embedding model's output dimension
    ),
    FieldSchema(
        name="title",
        dtype=DataType.VARCHAR,
        max_length=256
    ),
    FieldSchema(
        name="category",
        dtype=DataType.VARCHAR,
        max_length=64
    )
]

schema = CollectionSchema(
    fields=fields,
    description="A collection for storing document embeddings and metadata"
)
</code></pre>

---

#### Step 3: Create the Collection

Now, create the collection in Milvus:

<pre><code class="language-python">
from pymilvus import Collection

collection_name = "documents"
collection = Collection(
    name=collection_name,
    schema=schema
)
</code></pre>

---

#### Step 4: Verify the Collection

You can list all collections and check the schema to confirm creation:

<pre><code class="language-python">
from pymilvus import utility

print("Collections:", utility.list_collections())
print("Schema:", collection.schema)
</code></pre>

---

#### Step 5: (Optional) Drop the Collection

If you need to delete the collection (e.g., for testing):

<pre><code class="language-python">
collection.drop()
</code></pre>

---

### Summary

You’ve now created a Milvus collection with a schema tailored for storing document embeddings and associated metadata. This is the foundation for all subsequent data ingestion, search, and retrieval operations.

---

### Next Steps

Proceed to **Recipe 2** to learn how to insert vectors and metadata into your collection.




## Recipe 2: Inserting Vectors and Metadata

Once your collection and schema are set up, you’re ready to insert data—embeddings and their associated metadata—into Milvus. This recipe demonstrates how to batch-insert documents with embeddings generated by Azure OpenAI, along with titles and categories.

---

### Step 1: Prepare Your Data

Suppose you have a list of documents, each with a title, category, and text content. You’ll generate embeddings for each document and organize your data for insertion.

<pre><code class="language-python">
# Example documents
documents = [
    {"title": "AI in Healthcare", "category": "healthcare", "content": "AI is revolutionizing healthcare..."},
    {"title": "Gen AI in Finance", "category": "finance", "content": "Generative AI is transforming finance..."}
]
</code></pre>

---

### Step 2: Generate Embeddings with Azure OpenAI

<pre><code class="language-python">
import openai

openai.api_type = "azure"
openai.api_base = "https://<your-resource-name>.openai.azure.com/"
openai.api_version = "2023-05-15"
openai.api_key = "<your-azure-openai-key>"

def get_azure_openai_embedding(text, deployment="your-embedding-deployment"):
    response = openai.Embedding.create(
        input=text,
        engine=deployment
    )
    return response['data'][0]['embedding']

# Generate embeddings for each document
embeddings = [get_azure_openai_embedding(doc["content"], deployment="your-embedding-deployment") for doc in documents]
titles = [doc["title"] for doc in documents]
categories = [doc["category"] for doc in documents]
</code></pre>

---

### Step 3: Insert Data into Milvus

Milvus expects data in a column-oriented format (a list for each field, in the order defined by your schema).

<pre><code class="language-python">
# Assuming you have already created and connected to the collection as in Recipe 1
data = [
    embeddings,  # embedding vectors
    titles,      # title metadata
    categories   # category metadata
]

# Insert data (id is auto-generated)
collection.insert(data)
</code></pre>

---

### Step 4: Verify the Insert

You can check the number of entities in your collection:

<pre><code class="language-python">
print("Number of entities:", collection.num_entities)
</code></pre>

---

### Step 5: (Optional) Insert Data in Real Time

For streaming or real-time applications, you can insert new records as they arrive:

<pre><code class="language-python">
new_doc = {
    "title": "AI for Customer Support",
    "category": "customer_support",
    "content": "AI chatbots are improving customer support efficiency..."
}
new_embedding = get_azure_openai_embedding(new_doc["content"], deployment="your-embedding-deployment")

collection.insert([
    [new_embedding],  # embedding
    [new_doc["title"]],
    [new_doc["category"]]
])
</code></pre>

---

### Summary

You’ve now inserted embeddings and metadata into your Milvus collection, making your data ready for fast vector search and retrieval.

---

### Next Steps

Continue to **Recipe 3** to learn how to update and delete vectors in your collection.

## Recipe 3: Updating and Deleting Vectors

As your data evolves, you may need to update existing records (for example, to refresh embeddings or correct metadata) or delete records that are no longer relevant. Milvus provides efficient methods for both updating and deleting vectors and their associated metadata.

---

### Step 1: Understanding Updates in Milvus

Milvus does **not** support in-place updates of vector or scalar fields. To update a record, you must **delete the old record and insert a new one** with the updated data (using the same or a new primary key).

---

### Step 2: Deleting Vectors by Primary Key

Suppose you want to delete a document by its auto-generated id. First, you need to retrieve the id of the record you want to delete.

<pre><code class="language-python">
# Example: Search for a document by title to get its id
from pymilvus import Collection

collection = Collection("documents")

# Use an expression to filter by title
results = collection.query(
    expr="title == 'AI in Healthcare'",
    output_fields=["id"]
)
if results:
    doc_id = results[0]["id"]
    # Delete by primary key
    collection.delete(expr=f"id == {doc_id}")
    print(f"Deleted document with id {doc_id}")
else:
    print("Document not found.")
</code></pre>

---

### Step 3: Updating a Vector or Metadata

To update a record, delete the old record and insert the new one. If you want to keep the same id, you must manage primary keys manually (set `auto_id=False` in your schema). Otherwise, let Milvus generate a new id.

<pre><code class="language-python">
# Example: Update the category of a document

# 1. Find the document's id
results = collection.query(
    expr="title == 'Gen AI in Finance'",
    output_fields=["id", "embedding", "title"]
)
if results:
    doc_id = results[0]["id"]
    embedding = results[0]["embedding"]
    title = results[0]["title"]

    # 2. Delete the old record
    collection.delete(expr=f"id == {doc_id}")

    # 3. Insert the updated record (with new category)
    new_category = "fintech"
    collection.insert([
        [embedding],      # embedding
        [title],          # title
        [new_category]    # updated category
    ])
    print(f"Updated document '{title}' with new category '{new_category}'")
else:
    print("Document not found.")
</code></pre>

---

### Step 4: Deleting Multiple Records

You can delete multiple records using a filter expression. For example, to delete all documents in a certain category:

<pre><code class="language-python">
collection.delete(expr="category == 'customer_support'")
print("Deleted all documents in category 'customer_support'")
</code></pre>

---

### Summary

Milvus supports efficient deletion of records by primary key or filter expression. To update a record, delete the old entry and insert the new data. This approach ensures your vector database remains accurate and up to date.

---

### Next Steps

Proceed to **Recipe 4** to learn how to query your collection by vector similarity (KNN search).


## Recipe 4: Querying by Vector Similarity (KNN Search)

One of the most powerful features of Milvus is its ability to perform fast, scalable vector similarity search—also known as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) search. This allows you to find the most similar vectors (e.g., documents, images) to a given query vector, enabling use cases like semantic search, recommendations, and more.

---

### Step 1: Prepare Your Query Vector

Suppose you want to find documents similar to a new piece of text. First, generate an embedding for your query using the same model as your collection (e.g., Azure OpenAI or Hugging Face).

<pre><code class="language-python">
# Example: Generate a query embedding using Azure OpenAI
query_text = "How is AI used in healthcare?"
query_embedding = get_azure_openai_embedding(query_text, deployment="your-embedding-deployment")
</code></pre>

---

### Step 2: Perform the Vector Similarity Search

Use the `search` method on your Milvus collection. You can specify the number of nearest neighbors (`k`), the search parameters, and any additional filters (e.g., by category).

<pre><code class="language-python">
# Example: Search for the top 3 most similar documents
search_params = {
    "metric_type": "L2",  # or "IP" for inner product, "COSINE" for cosine similarity
    "params": {"nprobe": 10}
}

results = collection.search(
    data=[query_embedding],         # List of query vectors
    anns_field="embedding",         # Name of the vector field
    param=search_params,            # Search parameters
    limit=3,                        # Number of results to return
    output_fields=["title", "category"]  # Metadata fields to return
)

# Display results
for hits in results:
    for hit in hits:
        print(f"Score: {hit.distance:.4f}, Title: {hit.entity.get('title')}, Category: {hit.entity.get('category')}")
</code></pre>

---

### Step 3: (Optional) Hybrid Search with Scalar Filtering

You can combine vector similarity search with scalar filters to narrow down results. For example, search only within a specific category:

<pre><code class="language-python">
results = collection.search(
    data=[query_embedding],
    anns_field="embedding",
    param=search_params,
    limit=3,
    expr="category == 'healthcare'",  # Filter by category
    output_fields=["title", "category"]
)
</code></pre>

---

### Step 4: Interpreting the Results

- Each result contains the distance (similarity score) and the metadata fields you requested.
- Lower distance means higher similarity (for L2); higher score means higher similarity (for inner product or cosine).

---

### Summary

You’ve now performed a KNN vector similarity search in Milvus, retrieving the most relevant documents for your query. This is the foundation for building semantic search, recommendations, and other AI-powered applications.

---

### Next Steps

Explore advanced search options, such as adjusting search parameters for speed/accuracy trade-offs, or combining multiple filters for more complex queries.

## Recipe 5: Filtering with Metadata

In many enterprise applications, you need to combine vector similarity search with traditional filtering on metadata fields (such as category, date, or user). Milvus supports hybrid search, allowing you to filter results using scalar fields before or after performing vector similarity search. This recipe shows how to filter your search results using metadata.

---

### Step 1: Insert Data with Metadata (If Not Already Done)

Ensure your collection contains both embeddings and relevant metadata fields (e.g., title, category). See previous recipes for data insertion.

---

### Step 2: Build an Index (Recommended for Performance)

Before running searches, build an index on your vector field for faster queries:

<pre><code class="language-python">
index_params = {
    "index_type": "IVF_FLAT",
    "metric_type": "L2",
    "params": {"nlist": 128}
}
collection.create_index(field_name="embedding", index_params=index_params)
</code></pre>

---

### Step 3: Perform a Hybrid Search (Vector + Metadata Filter)

Suppose you want to find documents similar to a query, but only within a specific category.

<pre><code class="language-python">
import numpy as np

# Example query text and category filter
query_text = "How is AI used in healthcare?"
query_embedding = get_azure_openai_embedding(query_text, deployment="your-embedding-deployment")
category_filter = "healthcare"

# Hybrid search: vector similarity + metadata filter
search_params = {
    "metric_type": "L2",
    "params": {"nprobe": 10}
}

results = collection.search(
    data=[query_embedding],           # List of query vectors
    anns_field="embedding",           # Vector field name
    param=search_params,
    limit=5,                         # Top 5 results
    expr=f"category == '{category_filter}'",  # Metadata filter
    output_fields=["title", "category"]
)

for hits in results:
    for hit in hits:
        print(f"Title: {hit.entity.get('title')}, Category: {hit.entity.get('category')}, Distance: {hit.distance}")
</code></pre>

---

### Step 4: Filter by Multiple Metadata Fields

You can combine multiple filters using logical operators:

<pre><code class="language-python">
expr = "category == 'healthcare' and title like '%AI%'"
results = collection.search(
    data=[query_embedding],
    anns_field="embedding",
    param=search_params,
    limit=5,
    expr=expr,
    output_fields=["title", "category"]
)
</code></pre>

---

### Step 5: Filter Without Vector Search (Metadata-Only Query)

You can also query by metadata only, without vector search:

<pre><code class="language-python">
results = collection.query(
    expr="category == 'finance'",
    output_fields=["title", "category"]
)
for doc in results:
    print(doc)
</code></pre>

---

### Summary

### Next Steps

Proceed to advanced recipes to learn about scaling, indexing strategies, and integrating Milvus with LLMs for retrieval-augmented generation.




## Recipe 6: Hybrid Search (Combining Vector and Scalar Filters)

Hybrid search is a powerful feature of Milvus that allows you to combine vector similarity (semantic search) with traditional scalar (metadata) filtering. This is essential for enterprise applications where you want to retrieve the most relevant results, but only from a subset of your data defined by business rules, user permissions, or other metadata.

---

### Step 1: Ensure Your Collection Has Metadata Fields

Your collection schema should include both a vector field (e.g., `embedding`) and one or more scalar fields (e.g., `category`, `created_at`, `user_id`). See previous recipes for schema creation and data insertion.

---

### Step 2: Build an Index for Efficient Search

For best performance, create an index on your vector field:

<pre><code class="language-python">
index_params = {
    "index_type": "IVF_FLAT",
    "metric_type": "L2",
    "params": {"nlist": 128}
}
collection.create_index(field_name="embedding", index_params=index_params)
</code></pre>

---

### Step 3: Prepare Your Query Vector and Scalar Filter

Suppose you want to find the top 5 documents most similar to a query, but only within the "finance" category and created after a certain date.

<pre><code class="language-python">
import datetime

# Example query
query_text = "How is generative AI used in banking?"
query_embedding = get_azure_openai_embedding(query_text, deployment="your-embedding-deployment")

# Example scalar filter: category and created_at
category_filter = "finance"
date_filter = "2024-01-01"

expr = f"category == '{category_filter}' and created_at >= {int(datetime.datetime.strptime(date_filter, '%Y-%m-%d').timestamp())}"
</code></pre>

---

### Step 4: Run the Hybrid Search

<pre><code class="language-python">
search_params = {
    "metric_type": "L2",
    "params": {"nprobe": 10}
}

results = collection.search(
    data=[query_embedding],
    anns_field="embedding",
    param=search_params,
    limit=5,
    expr=expr,
    output_fields=["title", "category", "created_at"]
)

for hits in results:
    for hit in hits:
        print(f"Title: {hit.entity.get('title')}, Category: {hit.entity.get('category')}, Created At: {hit.entity.get('created_at')}, Distance: {hit.distance}")
</code></pre>

---

### Step 5: Use More Complex Filters

You can combine multiple scalar fields and use logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) for more advanced filtering:

<pre><code class="language-python">
expr = "category == 'finance' and (created_at >= 1704067200 or user_id == 12345)"
</code></pre>

---

### Step 6: Use Hybrid Search in LangChain

If you’re using LangChain, you can pass metadata filters directly when using Milvus as a retriever:

<pre><code class="language-python">
from langchain.vectorstores import Milvus

vectorstore = Milvus(
    embedding_function=get_azure_openai_embedding,
    collection_name="documents",
    connection_args={"host": "localhost", "port": "19530"}
)

docs = vectorstore.similarity_search(
    query_text,
    k=5,
    filter={"category": "finance", "created_at": {"$gte": 1704067200}}
)
for doc in docs:
    print(doc.page_content, doc.metadata)
</code></pre>

---

### Summary

Hybrid search in Milvus lets you combine the power of semantic vector search with precise metadata filtering, enabling highly relevant and context-aware results for enterprise AI applications.

## Recipe 7: Scaling Milvus for Large Datasets

As your enterprise AI applications grow, you may need to store and search millions or even billions of vectors. Milvus is designed to scale both vertically and horizontally, supporting high throughput and low-latency queries on large datasets. This recipe covers best practices for scaling Milvus in production environments, with a focus on Kubernetes deployments.

---

### Step 1: Choose the Right Deployment Mode

- **Standalone Mode:** Suitable for development, testing, and small-scale workloads (up to a few million vectors).
- **Cluster Mode on Kubernetes:** Recommended for production and large-scale workloads. In this mode, Milvus distributes data and query load across multiple pods and nodes, providing scalability and high availability.

---

### Step 2: Plan Your Kubernetes Cluster

- **Node Sizing:** Use nodes with sufficient CPU, memory, and SSD storage. For large datasets, prioritize high IOPS SSDs.
- **Networking:** Ensure low-latency, high-bandwidth networking between nodes for optimal performance.
- **Namespace Organization:** Deploy Milvus in a dedicated namespace for easier management and resource isolation.

---

### Step 3: Resource Allocation and Scaling

- **Pod Resources:** Assign appropriate CPU and memory requests/limits to each Milvus component (`DataNode`, `QueryNode`, `IndexNode`, etc.) in your Kubernetes manifests.
- **Horizontal Scaling:** Increase the number of replicas for `QueryNode` and other stateless components to handle higher query loads.
- **Vertical Scaling:** Adjust resource limits for pods as your workload grows.

---

### Step 4: Partitioning and Sharding

- **Partitions:** Use Milvus partitions to logically separate data (e.g., by customer, region, or time period). This can improve query performance and manageability.
- **Sharding:** In cluster mode, Milvus automatically shards data across nodes for load balancing and fault tolerance.

**Example (Python):**
<pre><code class="language-python">
collection.create_partition("2024_Q1")
collection.insert(data, partition_name="2024_Q1")
</code></pre>

---

### Step 5: Indexing Strategies for Large Datasets

- **Index Type:** Choose an index type optimized for your dataset size and query pattern (e.g., `IVF_FLAT`, `IVF_SQ8`, `HNSW`).
- **Index Parameters:** Tune parameters such as `nlist` (for IVF) or `M` and `efConstruction` (for HNSW) for optimal performance.

**Example:**
<pre><code class="language-python">
index_params = {
    "index_type": "IVF_SQ8",
    "metric_type": "L2",
    "params": {"nlist": 2048}
}
collection.create_index(field_name="embedding", index_params=index_params)
</code></pre>

---

### Step 6: Monitor and Optimize Performance

- **Monitoring:** Integrate Milvus with Kubernetes monitoring tools such as Prometheus and Grafana to track resource usage, query latency, and throughput.
- **Auto-Scaling:** Use Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to automatically scale Milvus components based on CPU or custom metrics.
- **Backup and Restore:** Implement regular backup and restore procedures to ensure data durability and business continuity.

---

### Step 7: Consider Managed Services

If you want to avoid infrastructure management, consider using a managed Milvus service (e.g., Zilliz Cloud), which handles scaling, upgrades, and maintenance for you.

---

### Summary

Scaling Milvus for large datasets in Kubernetes involves deploying in cluster mode, allocating sufficient resources, partitioning and sharding data, optimizing indexes, and monitoring performance. With these best practices, Milvus can efficiently handle enterprise-scale vector search workloads.

---

### Next Steps

Continue to advanced recipes on optimizing indexing strategies and integrating Milvus with LLMs for retrieval-augmented generation.




## Recipe 8: Indexing Strategies for Performance

Efficient indexing is critical for achieving fast and accurate vector search in Milvus, especially as your dataset grows. The right indexing strategy can dramatically improve query latency and throughput, while balancing memory and storage usage. This recipe covers how to choose, configure, and manage indexes in Milvus for optimal performance.

---

### Step 1: Understand Index Types

Milvus supports several index types, each with its own trade-offs:

- **FLAT:** Brute-force search. Accurate but slow for large datasets. Good for small collections or high-accuracy needs.
- **IVF_FLAT / IVF_SQ8:** Inverted File (IVF) indexes partition vectors into clusters for faster search. IVF_SQ8 adds quantization for reduced memory usage.
- **HNSW:** Hierarchical Navigable Small World graph. Fast and accurate for large-scale, high-dimensional data.
- **ANNOY:** Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah. Good for read-heavy workloads and static datasets.

> **Tip:** The best index depends on your dataset size, query pattern, and accuracy requirements.

---

### Step 2: Choose the Right Index for Your Use Case

- **Small datasets (<100K vectors):** FLAT or IVF_FLAT.
- **Medium to large datasets (100K+ vectors):** IVF_FLAT, IVF_SQ8, or HNSW.
- **High recall and low latency:** HNSW.
- **Memory-constrained environments:** IVF_SQ8.

---

### Step 3: Create an Index

After inserting data, create an index on your vector field. For example, to use IVF_SQ8:

<pre><code class="language-python">
index_params = {
    "index_type": "IVF_SQ8",
    "metric_type": "L2",  # or "IP" for inner product/cosine similarity
    "params": {"nlist": 2048}  # nlist: number of clusters
}
collection.create_index(field_name="embedding", index_params=index_params)
</code></pre>

**Key Parameters:**

- **nlist (IVF):** Number of clusters. Higher values = more accurate, but more memory and slower build time.
- **nprobe (search):** Number of clusters to search. Higher values = more accurate, but slower queries.
- **M, efConstruction (HNSW):** Control graph connectivity and index build time/accuracy.

---

### Step 4: Tune Search Parameters

When searching, you can adjust parameters for speed/accuracy trade-offs:

<pre><code class="language-python">
search_params = {
    "metric_type": "L2",
    "params": {"nprobe": 10}  # Number of clusters to search
}
results = collection.search(
    data=[query_embedding],
    anns_field="embedding",
    param=search_params,
    limit=5,
    output_fields=["title", "category"]
)
</code></pre>

---

### Step 5: Monitor and Rebuild Indexes

- **Monitor Query Latency:** Use Milvus metrics and logs to track search performance.
- **Rebuild Indexes:** If you add a large amount of new data, consider rebuilding the index to maintain optimal performance.
- **Index Storage:** Ensure your storage backend (preferably SSD) can handle the index size.

---

### Step 6: Index Management Best Practices

- **Index After Bulk Insert:** For large initial data loads, insert all data first, then build the index.
- **Update Indexes as Needed:** For streaming data, schedule periodic index rebuilds or use Milvus’s auto-indexing features.
- **Test Different Indexes:** Benchmark different index types and parameters on a sample of your data to find the best fit.

---

### Summary

Choosing and tuning the right index is essential for high-performance vector search in Milvus. Consider your dataset size, query needs, and available resources when selecting and configuring indexes. Regularly monitor and maintain your indexes as your data evolves.

---

### Next Steps

Proceed to advanced recipes on integrating Milvus with LLMs for retrieval-augmented generation and securing your Milvus deployment.


## Recipe 9: Integrating Milvus with LLMs for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful technique that combines the strengths of large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge retrieval from a vector database like Milvus. By integrating Milvus with LLMs, you can build applications that generate more accurate, up-to-date, and context-aware responses by grounding LLM outputs in your own data.

---

- Generate embeddings for each document using the same model you’ll use for queries (e.g., OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Hugging Face).

---

### Step 2: Generate Query Embeddings

When a user submits a query, convert the query into an embedding using the same model as your document embeddings.

<pre><code class="language-python">
query_text = "What are the latest trends in enterprise AI?"
query_embedding = get_azure_openai_embedding(query_text, deployment="your-embedding-deployment")
</code></pre>

---

### Step 3: Retrieve Relevant Documents from Milvus

<pre><code class="language-python">
search_params = {
    "metric_type": "L2",
    "params": {"nprobe": 10}
}

results = collection.search(
    data=[query_embedding],
    anns_field="embedding",
    param=search_params,
    limit=5,
    output_fields=["title", "content"]
)

# Extract the content of the top results
retrieved_docs = [hit.entity.get("content") for hits in results for hit in hits]
</code></pre>

---

### Step 4: Construct the LLM Prompt with Retrieved Context

Combine the retrieved documents with the user’s query to create a context-rich prompt for the LLM.

<pre><code class="language-python">
context = "\n\n".join(retrieved_docs)
prompt = f"Context:\n{context}\n\nQuestion: {query_text}\n\nAnswer:"
</code></pre>

---

### Step 5: Generate the Final Answer with the LLM

Pass the constructed prompt to your LLM (e.g., OpenAI GPT, Azure OpenAI, Hugging Face Transformers) to generate a grounded, context-aware response.

<pre><code class="language-python">
import openai

response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    engine="your-llm-deployment",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
    ]
)
answer = response['choices'][0]['message']['content']
print(answer)
</code></pre>

---

### Step 6: (Optional) Use LangChain or LlamaIndex for RAG Pipelines

Frameworks like [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/) and [LlamaIndex](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/) provide higher-level abstractions for building RAG pipelines with Milvus, including chunking, retrieval, and prompt management.

<pre><code class="language-python">
from langchain.vectorstores import Milvus
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

vectorstore = Milvus(
    embedding_function=get_azure_openai_embedding,
    collection_name="documents",
    connection_args={"host": "localhost", "port": "19530"}
)

qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
    llm=OpenAI(),
    retriever=vectorstore.as_retriever()
)

result = qa_chain({"query": query_text})
print(result["result"])
</code></pre>

---

### Summary

By integrating Milvus with LLMs for Retrieval-Augmented Generation, you can build applications that deliver more accurate, relevant, and trustworthy answers by grounding LLM outputs in your own data. This approach is essential for enterprise AI, chatbots, knowledge assistants, and more.

---

### Next Steps

- **Efficient Storage Management:**  
  Use high-performance SSDs for active data and indexes, but consider tiered storage or archiving for infrequently accessed data.

- **Monitor and Tune Regularly:**  
  Continuously monitor resource usage and query patterns. Adjust configurations and scale resources to avoid waste and maintain performance.

### Security Considerations

- **Restrict Network Access:**  
  Expose Milvus only to trusted networks. Use firewalls, security groups, or Kubernetes network policies to limit access.

- **Enable Authentication and Authorization:**  
  Use Milvus’s role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user permissions. Apply the principle of least privilege.

- **Encrypt Data in Transit and at Rest:**  
  Enable TLS/SSL for all client-server communications. Use encrypted storage volumes for data and backups.

- **Secure Secrets and Configurations:**  
  Store sensitive information (API keys, credentials, certificates) in secure vaults or Kubernetes secrets. Limit access to configuration files.

- **Regularly Update and Patch:**  
  Keep Milvus, dependencies, and your operating environment up to date with the latest security patches.

- **Audit and Monitor:**  
  Enable logging and audit trails. Regularly review logs for unauthorized access or suspicious activity.
