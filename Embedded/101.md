# Low energy considerations
* Enerby harvesting or pattery powered
* Processor load analytsis
* Lower clock speed
  * Doent waste time ideling at full speed
  * Startup overhead
  * SHut down unused periferials
  * voltage reference (consume current)
    * brown out detector
    * adc

Can use a real time clock(watch crystal) to take system at a specific time

# Async vs Syunc

Async requires higher clock speeds
