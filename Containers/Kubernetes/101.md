# Pod
* A container 
    * could be multipel containers but 1
    * Effemeral can die easily
    * Has own ip address
    * When it is respawn it has a different IP

# Service
* so we dont have to map IP addresses.
* Even if the pod dies the IP and service address lives
* does load balencing (when multple comtainer)

# Ingress
* Service is are interanal Ingress is external

# Config map
* Config for application
* It is dynamic you dont have to rebuild your image
* Don't put secretes here

# Secret 
* Like config map but used to store credentials and other secretes
* Store base 64 encoded
* Store certs
* like configmap just attach it to your pod
* use it as envionmental varabies or properties file


# Volumes
* Data Storage
* Attaches physical storage
* Can be local on machine or can be external such as cloud storage
* Data persisted

# Deployment
* Blueprint
* tells how many replicas of pods we need
* Abstraction ontop of pods


# StatfulSet
* Specically for Statful apps like:
    * Mongo
    * Elastic Search
* Is not easy :(
